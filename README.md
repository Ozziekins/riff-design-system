# Riff Design System

Riff is the official design system for [Fender Play](https://www.fender.com/play). It provides a cohesive, accessible, and flexible foundation for building user interfaces across Fender Play's web products.

Inspired by leading systems like IBM Carbon, Google Material, and Twilio Paste, Riff is tailored to support a modern learning platform with an authentic Fender tone.

## Tokens

Design tokens are centrally defined in `src/tokens/`:

* **colors.ts**
* **typography.ts**
* **spacing.ts**
* **radii.ts**

Tokens are used consistently across all components to ensure alignment between Figma designs and implementation.
