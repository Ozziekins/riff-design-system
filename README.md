# Riff Design System

Riff is the official design system for [Fender Play](https://www.fender.com/play). It provides a cohesive, accessible, and flexible foundation for building user interfaces across Fender Play‚Äôs web products.

Inspired by leading systems like IBM Carbon, Google Material, and Twilio Paste, Riff is tailored to support a modern learning platform with an authentic Fender tone.

## Build & Deployment

### Dual Build System

| Command                   | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build:lib`       | Build component library for packaging (npm, internal use) |
| `npm run build`           | Build the PoC app (for GitHub Pages or Netlify deploy)    |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Build Storybook static site (for GitHub Pages deploy)     |

---

### GitHub Actions

* CI is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
* On every push to `main`:

  * Library is built and tested
  * App is built and tested
  * Storybook is built
  * Storybook is deployed to GitHub Pages

---

## Usage

The Riff Design System can be consumed in Fender Play apps as a React component library.

Library exports are defined in `src/index.ts`:

```tsx
import { Button, Heading, Stack } from '@fender/riff';
```

Planned packaging:

* Internal NPM package: `@fender/riff`
* Available for direct import in React apps
