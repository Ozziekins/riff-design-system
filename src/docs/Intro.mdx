# üé∏ Fender Play Design System

Welcome to the official design system powering **Fender Play**.

## üí° Purpose
To provide a consistent, accessible, and expressive UI for learners and music lovers.


## 1. Introducing Your Design System with a Resonating Brand Name

### Brand Name: **Riff**

**Justification:**
"Riff" is a short, punchy, and memorable name that draws directly from the language of music‚Äîparticularly guitar playing. A riff is a repeated chord progression or refrain in music that forms the backbone of a song. Similarly, this design system forms the consistent, reusable foundation upon which Fender Play interfaces are built. The name evokes creativity, rhythm, and continuity‚Äîkey traits in both music education and great UI design. Riff captures the essence of Fender‚Äôs brand while being approachable and developer-friendly.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Content Guidelines

#### Voice and Tone
**Voice**: Friendly, supportive, and motivational. Like a personal coach.
**Tone**: Confident but never arrogant, clear but never robotic.

**It is:**
- Encouraging: "You‚Äôre doing great‚Äîkeep going!"
- Clear: "Next, try this chord."
- Positive: "You‚Äôve unlocked your next lesson."

**It is not:**
- Sarcastic: "Really? That‚Äôs the best you can do?"
- Overly casual: "Yo, let‚Äôs shred some chords, dude."

#### Copywriting Guidelines
- Keep it concise and actionable
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon
- Highlight benefits in CTAs: "Start Practicing" vs. "Submit"
- Use sentence case (except proper nouns and titles)

#### Use of Illustrations/Imagery
- **Style**: Clean, modern vector illustrations that align with Fender‚Äôs branding
- **Purpose**: Visual reinforcement of learning moments, onboarding, empty states
- **Guidelines**:
  - Avoid cluttered visuals
  - Use illustrations to explain or motivate, not distract
  - Use diverse representation across personas

#### Elevation and Hierarchy
- Use **shadow**, **scale**, and **spacing** to indicate hierarchy
- Elevate interactive elements (e.g., buttons, modals)
- Use color contrast and type scale for scannability
- Group related elements using cards or containers
